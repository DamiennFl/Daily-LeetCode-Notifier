# Daily LeetCode Notifier
- Text bot which sends me information about the daily LeetCode problem straight to my phone.
- Uses a simple Python script, gmail's SMTP server, and a query to LeetCode's GraphQL.
- Note that this can be automated with a CRON job from a website like https://cron-job.org/en/.
